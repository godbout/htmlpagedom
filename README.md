## REPO STOLEN!!!

i stole this repo from [Christoph Singer](https://github.com/wasinger) at https://github.com/wasinger/htmlpagedom 

please use his repo instead and give him a bit of money for the prejudice. thanks.

## WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT???!!!?

i'm a bandit.

also, the current repo you're looking at says:
* bye bye Travis hello GitHub Actions
* hello PHP8.0
* bye bye PHP7.2 and 7.3
* hello StyleCI and PSR12 and php-cs-fixer and php-codesniffer

## WHY YOU NO PR??!!?!??!

https://github.com/wasinger/htmlpagedom/issues/35

## PUSHED ON PACKAGIST WTFFFFFFF???@???@??!??!

https://github.com/godbout/dash-docset-builder/issues/9

unfortunately you can't seem to be able to use your own [Repository](https://github.com/godbout/dash-docset-builder/issues/9) if you don't use a root `composer.json.` the [dash-docset-builder](https://github.com/godbout/dash-docset-builder) tool doesn't require you to create any file, you just require from composer and BOOM it works. to be able to do that, i had to get `htmlpagedom` support PHP8.0. hence the fork. hence the push. if you have a better way, let me know.
